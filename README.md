# SparkX120's Synthetic WebWorker
This npm module is designed to work with browserify and passes my web worker wrapper library back.
The library allows an arbitrary javascript function to be encoded into a webworker and also provides a simple callback interface for
the lifecycle of the webworker. Further Documentation will be posted later.
